**Objective**

The objective of the TwoSix_LLM project is to streamline the process of generating fuzzy maps from scientific passages related to offshore fishing/wind turbines. This involves two main tasks: creating a user interface (UI) for data labeling and fine-tuning existing Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract causal relationships from scientific publications. The UI will help researchers label more data which will feed into the finetuning.

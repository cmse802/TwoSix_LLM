# Instructions to Graph Mistral Fine Tuning Loss over Training Iterations:    
In mistral-finetune-own-data-tutorial.ipynb, there is a section under part 5 that generates a cross entropy loss graph over the training iterations.  
This section automatically extracts the loss while training the fine tuned model, saves it to a CSV, and reads in the CSV to generate a graph.  
These graphs will automatically generate after training the LLM.
